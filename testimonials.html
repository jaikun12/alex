				<p><i>"Let me make your decision easier: Go for it! I started Lisa&rsquo;s classes a year ago, worried I&lsquo;ll be totally out of place as I didn&rsquo;t do ballet as a child and from class one, I found Lisa&rsquo;s instructions easy to follow and within few weeks, I felt like ballet had always been a part of my life."</i></p>

				<p><i>"The atmosphere in the class is fantastic! Since all are grown us and not as flexible as we once were, there is no pressure of performing like a professional dancer. I can highly recommend adult ballet even to those who does not have a typical &lsquo;ballerina body&rsquo; like me."</i></p>

				<p><i>"I looked longingly at my girls&rsquo; fitting about in their ballet outfits and wished I could have learned ballet as a child. I was thrilled when Lisa started adult ballet and could finally have my very own pair of ballet shoes. It has been a challenging and stimulating way to get fit, but I love learning something new whilst exercising and the lesson flies by."</i></p>
